<tr><p style="color:#ffffff">Me and my partner decided we wanted to do something simple yet fun, so we settled with choosing a game. We decided to go with hangman, as we already had some past experience with creating hangman games. However, even though we had this experience, we still ran into many problems along the way. We had two major problems along the way, one of which was our struggle to create a list of the wrong letters guessed. However, my partner and I were able to work through it by using trial and error with our code until we eventually got it running. One of the other problems we had was trying to get the input to turn into dashes. I was able to fix this myself by again a process of trial and error as well as referencing past code in which I solved a similar task.</p></tr>

<p style="color:#ffffff">The video demonstrates multiple functions of me and my partner's code. It shows the execution of the while loop, which enters the player into the game. It asks if the user wants to play, and if the answer is yes they are then prompted to type the word they want to guess. A for loop is then executed which turns the user's word into dashes. In the video, the incorrect guess is put into a visible list of incorrect guesses, and loses pne try. However, when the user guesses a correct letter it is shown and the user is told they are correct.</p>
