				<center>Bling Bling Boy: A Short Description</center>
				<center>Bling-Bling is usually villainous at times, though he will act friendly towards Johnny, mainly because he sees a bit of himself in the flame-headed boy. To this end, he'll team up with Johnny and his friends to defeat another villain. Although he is well aware Susan doesn't share his romantic feelings (even when she says it to his face that she doesn't like him), he's very persistent and refuses to give up, making all kinds of inventions and schemes to win her over, even going as far as to blackmail her.
Deep down Bling-Bling Boy is insecure due to being fat and having buck teeth although in Phat Johnny, his weight and buck teeth actually help Bling-Bling Boy become successful as a hip hop star.
Although he wouldn't admit it, he craves human interaction and builds robots to cope with this, which Johnny claims is sad (Johnny's Big Dumb Sisters).</center>
