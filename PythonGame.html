<tr>When we began writing our story, we wanted to create something simple for the player to understand yet funny and entertaining in order to immerse the player. We decided to go with something currently relevant, the competition for the most subscribers on Youtube between T-Series and Pewdiepie. We figured this would be the perfect topic as many people would understand the simple struggle of the main character and we could easily exaggerate the story. After we created the story, we began writing the code, and we immediately ran into a problem. The loop that we had in our text would be broken every so often and the whole program would have to be restarted, and due to the program being relatively new, my partner would have to send me a new link everytime this happened. However, everytime we were able to overcome this obstacle through a process of trial and error with the code. Another issue we faced was the game lacked depth. In order to fix this, my partner added more choices and I made improvements to the story, adding large amounts of detail to each choice. This helped the whole game overall, as it became more in depth and fun to play.</tr>

<p>As you can see, our story consists of up to 7 different choices which will either progress you to the end of the game and an eventual win or it will restart you. I choose all 7 choices correctly, which takes me to the end of the game where text is created saying that I win. <p>
